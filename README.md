# ArtistCorner

ArtistCorner is a desktop and mobile application software that allows
professional artists but especially amateurs to emerge and be noticed by
art galleries around the world.

The application allows the artist to upload his artwork, put it on sale,
and in moments of creative blocks, get artistic recommendation from the
system on what to draw. The works uploaded by the artist can be viewed
by general users to be purchased via Paypal or by art galleries, which
can be viewed in contact with the artist by forwarding a collaboration
proposal.
